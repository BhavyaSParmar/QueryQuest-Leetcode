## 📌 Problem-Solving Approach

> For each SQL challenge:

- ✅ The problem is first analyzed for expected input/output formats.
- 🧠 SQL logic is constructed with performance and readability in mind.
- 💡 Whenever possible, solutions leverage best practices like filtering early, avoiding SELECT *, and using proper indexing strategies (where applicable).
- 🧪 Code is tested in LeetCode’s online editor and marked as "Accepted" before uploading.
